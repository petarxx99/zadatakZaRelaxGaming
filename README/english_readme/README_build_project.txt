open terminal there and type npm i.
From this point on there are 2 things that you can do:

1)If you just want to see developer build then type npm start into terminal.
After the build is over in the terminal you will se the address where the website is locally hosted.


2) If you want to have production build instead of typing 
npm start into terminal type npm run build. 
After the build is over type npm install -g serve in the terminal and click enter. 
After that type serve -s build in the terminal and click enter.
Go to the address that will be shown on the terminal.
